This test suite shows every feature and looking at source is the best full example: https://github.com/tgicloud/tgi-spec/blob/master/lib/tgi-spec.test.js    

#### METHODS
#### heading(text,function(){})
heading test followed by optional function used for indenting structure.  The presentation may reflect this as heading levels (todo for github markdown).    

#### paragraph(text)
here is the best example: https://github.com/tgicloud/tgi-spec/blob/master/lib/tgi-spec.test.js    

#### example(text, results, testFunction)
The example function provides a test description, expected outcome and function to invoke for test.  to disable a test spec.xexample is provided also.    

&nbsp;<b><i>Code with no errors:</i></b>
```javascript
// Hello World
```
&nbsp;<b><i>Code with expected return value:</i></b>
```javascript
return true;
```
<blockquote>returns <strong>true</strong> as expected
</blockquote>
&nbsp;<b><i>Errors can be returned:</i></b>
```javascript
return Error('wrong');
```
<blockquote>returns <strong>Error: wrong</strong> as expected
</blockquote>
&nbsp;<b><i>Errors can be thrown:</i></b>
```javascript
throw Error('wrong');
```
<blockquote><strong>Error: wrong</strong> thrown as expected
</blockquote>
&nbsp;<b><i>Can contain one or more assertions:</i></b>
```javascript
this.shouldBeTrue(2 === 2);
this.shouldBeFalse(0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3);
this.shouldBeTruthy('To thine own self be true');
this.shouldBeFalsy('');
this.shouldBeTruthy(42);
this.shouldBeFalsy(0);
this.shouldThrowError('*', function () { // Any error
  throw Error();
});
this.shouldThrowError(Error('fubar'), function () {
  throw Error('fubar');
});
```
&nbsp;<b><i>Expected results can be asynchronous:</i></b>
```javascript
this.shouldBeTrue(true); // false breaks test
setTimeout(function () {
  callback(42); // comment out to test timeouts
}, 0);
```
<blockquote>returns <strong>42</strong> as expected
</blockquote>
&nbsp;<b><i>can log expression output:</i></b>
```javascript
this.log('ponder the meaning of life: ' + 42 * 10);
```
<blockquote><strong>log: </strong>ponder the meaning of life: 420<br></blockquote>
#### mute(true/false)
Tests can be muted.  All documentation will be muted but tests will be run.  Return value is object with stats of run tests.    

&nbsp;<b><i>check function and return value:</i></b>
```javascript
var mutedTests = spec.mute(false);
this.log(JSON.stringify(mutedTests));
return mutedTests.testsCreated;
```
<blockquote><strong>log: </strong>{"testsCreated":0}<br></blockquote>
&nbsp;<b><i>mute enabled:</i></b>
```javascript
spec.mute(true);
```
&nbsp;<b><i>should have 2 muted test now:</i></b>
```javascript
